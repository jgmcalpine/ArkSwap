## 🌊 Overview

**ArkSwap** is a **research prototype** and **reference implementation** designed to explore the programmable nature of the **Ark Layer 2 Protocol**. It simulates a trustless atomic swap architecture where **Ark VTXOs** are exchanged for **Bitcoin Layer 1** funds within a controlled **Regtest** environment.

ArkSwap serves as an educational proof-of-concept for **Off-Chain Programmability**. It provides a working demonstration of how an Ark Service Provider (ASP) can process transfers that **target VTXOs encumbered by custom Taproot HTLCs** (Hash Time-Locked Contracts), illustrating how advanced conditional logic can exist natively within Ark protocol rounds.

## 📖 User Story: The Sovereign Exit

**Meet Elena**, a freelancer who gets paid in Bitcoin. She uses **Ark (Layer 2)** for her weekly paycheck because it's instant, private, and works even when her wallet is offline.

But Elena doesn't want to keep her life savings on a Layer 2 hot wallet. She wants to move them to her **Hardware Wallet (Layer 1)** for long-term security.

### The Problem
Moving money from L2 to L1 usually requires:
1.  **A Centralized Exchange:** Requires trusting a custodian.
2.  **Individual On-Chain Transactions:** Paying a variable mining fee every single week is expensive and permanently ties her on-chain addresses to her employer.

### The ArkSwap Solution
Elena uses ArkSwap as her **trustless bridge**.

1.  **The Batch:** She accumulates 4 weekly paychecks in her Ark Wallet.
2.  **The Swap:** She uses ArkSwap to convert all 4 VTXOs into a single Bitcoin L1 transaction sent directly to her cold storage.
3.  **The Savings:** Instead of paying 4 mining fees, she pays just **one**.

**The Critical Difference:**
ArkSwap is not an exchange. Elena sends her funds to a **Smart Contract (HTLC)**, not a company wallet.
*   **If it works:** She gets her Bitcoin on L1 instantly.
*   **If it fails:** The contract automatically unlocks, and she reclaims her funds via the "Refund" button.

**Elena moves from "Cash" (Ark) to "Gold" (Bitcoin) without ever trusting a third party, at the cadence that works best for her financial and security goals.**

## 🧩 What's Real vs. Simulated

ArkSwap is designed as a **Research Prototype** operating within a **Local Regtest Simulation**.

The codebase executes valid Bitcoin cryptographic primitives to demonstrate the logic of atomic swaps, but abstracts the expensive network settlement layers to create a lightweight educational environment.

| Component | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Cryptography** | ✅ **Real** | We implement raw **Schnorr Signatures**, **BIP-86 Key Tweaking**, and **Taproot Address** derivation using standard Bitcoin libraries. |
| **Smart Contracts** | ✅ **Real** | We compile actual **Bitcoin Script** (HTLCs) into Taproot Merkle Trees. The script logic matches the Ark protocol specification. |
| **Blockchain Node** | ✅ **Real** | We run a genuine **Bitcoin Core** node (Regtest). Time travel and block height are enforced by the actual daemon, not a database counter. |
| **Market Maker** | ⚠️ **Hybrid** | The trading logic (quoting, locking, verifying) functions autonomously, but it is funded with **Regtest Bitcoin** for demonstration purposes. |
| **ASP (Network)** | ⚠️ **Hybrid** | The ASP performs real **Input Validation** (checking signatures against pubkeys), but it "mocks" the final **L1 Broadcast** of the Round Transaction. |
| **Onboarding (Lift)** | ❌ **Mocked** | L1 -> L2 deposits are triggered via an API call for instant feedback, rather than waiting for an L1 funding transaction to confirm. |

## 🛠 Tech Stack

This project is organized as a **TurboRepo** monorepo representing a complete L2 ecosystem.

*   **Apps:**
    *   `apps/web`: **Next.js 14** - The client-side **Ark Wallet**. Features **TanStack Query** for reactive state, **Zod** for runtime validation, and **Coin Control** for UTXO management.
    *   `apps/asp`: **NestJS** - A custom, lightweight **Ark Service Provider**. It coordinates rounds, manages the VTXO set, and validates programmable transfers via Schnorr signatures.
    *   `apps/api`: **NestJS** - The **Market Maker** backend. It quotes swaps, watches the ASP for locked funds, and broadcasts L1 Bitcoin transactions.
*   **Packages:**
    *   `packages/protocol`: Shared **TypeScript** library containing the core Bitcoin/Ark cryptographic logic (HTLC scripts, deterministic hashing, witness construction).
*   **Infrastructure:**
    *   **Docker:** Orchestrates the local "Universe": Bitcoin Core (Regtest), ASP, Postgres, and Redis.
    *   **Playwright:** End-to-End testing suite ensuring the critical path works from Lift to Swap to Exit.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the entire ArkSwap ecosystem locally.

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js** (v18+) & **pnpm**
*   **Docker Desktop** (Running)

### 1. Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jgmcalpine/arkswap.git
cd arkswap
pnpm install
```

### 2. Start the Infrastructure (The Universe)
Spin up the local Bitcoin Regtest node and Ark Service Provider (ASP).
```bash
cd docker
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### 3. Run the Development Servers
Start the Frontend (`localhost:3000`) and Backend (`localhost:3001`).
```bash
# From the root directory
# Note: Excludes the ASP since it runs in Docker
pnpm dev --filter=!@arkswap/asp
```

### 4. "God Mode" (Funding & Simulation)
Since this runs on Regtest, you control the blockchain. We provide scripts to mine blocks and fund wallets.

**Check Blockchain Status:**
```bash
./scripts/get-info.sh
```

**Mine Blocks (Time Travel):**
```bash
# Mines 101 blocks to mature coinbase rewards
./scripts/mine.sh 101
```

**Fund the Market Maker:**
```bash
# Sends 50 BTC to the Backend API wallet
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/faucet/maker
```

### 5. Try out the app

Visit ```localhost:3000``` and you will see the frontend for the app.

**Happy Path:**
Connect Wallet --> Deposit --> Set amount to swap --> Request Quote --> Enter L1 Address (```docker exec -it bitcoind bitcoin-cli -regtest -rpcuser=ark -rpcpassword=ark getnewaddress```) --> Confirm Swap --> Boom! Trustless swapping from L2 back to L1.

**Something Went Wrong Path:**
Connect Wallet --> Deposit --> Set amount to swap --> Check 'Simulate Backend Crash' --> Request Quote --> Enter L1 Address --> Confirm Swap --> Move blockchain forward 24 blocks (```./scripts/mine.sh 24```) --> Claim Refund --> Boom! Even if the Market Maker disappears, your funds are yours.

## 🚧 Phase 2: Protocol Parity & The Unilateral Exit

We are currently upgrading ArkSwap to move from a **Simulated L2** to a **Cryptographically Complete L2**.

While the current version demonstrates the *Application Layer* (Swaps), Phase 2 targets the *Consensus Layer* (Exits). We are replacing the mocked ASP infrastructure with a fully compliant implementation to demonstrate the "Nuclear Option" of the Ark Protocol.

**The Upgrade Scope:**
*   **True Round Settlement:** The ASP will no longer "pretend" to finalize rounds. It will construct and broadcast actual **Transaction Trees** to the Bitcoin Regtest network.
*   **Connector Management:** The Client will download and verify the specific branch of pre-signed "Connector Transactions" required to secure their VTXOs.
*   **The "Red Button" (Ark Exit):** We will implement the **Double Unilateral Exit** directly in the dashboard. Users will be able to simulate an ASP failure and manually broadcast the multi-stage transaction chain (Pool → Connector → Branch → Leaf) to recover their funds on L1 without permission.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please note that this project deals with financial cryptography, so we enforce strict quality controls.

This repository contains Research Code. It is not intended for deployment. Pull Requests that attempt to remove Regtest constraints or add Mainnet configuration support will be closed immediately.

### Development Workflow

1.  **Strict Types:** We use TypeScript strict mode. No `any` casts are allowed.
2.  **Shared Logic:** All cryptographic logic belongs in `packages/protocol`, not in the apps.

### Verification (Running Tests)

Before pushing code, please run the following suites to ensure CI will pass.

**1. Code Quality (Fast)**
Runs linter, strict type checking, and protocol unit tests.
```bash
pnpm turbo lint
pnpm turbo type-check
pnpm --filter @arkswap/protocol test
```

**1. End-to-End Assurance (Slow)**
Runs the Playwright suite against the local Docker environment.
```bash
# Ensure Docker is running first
cd docker && docker-compose up -d

# Run E2E Tests
cd ..
pnpm --filter @arkswap/web test:e2e
```

## Project Structure
* **apps/web:** Next.js Frontend (Client)
* **apps/api:** NestJS Market Maker (Liquidity Provider)
* **apps/asp:** NestJS Ark Service Provider (Protocol Coordinator)
* **packages/protocol:** Shared Cryptography & Types
